#Bloc Jams
This is a single page web application implemented in HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. The app is intended to be a [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) clone, and was built during the Foundation portion of Bloc's [Frontend Web Development](https://www.bloc.io/frontend-development-bootcamp) coding bootcamp.

It allows you to choose among different albums and songs with play, pause, seek, and skip functionality.

## Starting the app
The application can be downloaded and run in any modern browser. A freeware music library loads with the application, but any library of mp3 files can be used.

## Dependencies

The app also uses jQuery 2.1.3 and the Ionicicons library.
